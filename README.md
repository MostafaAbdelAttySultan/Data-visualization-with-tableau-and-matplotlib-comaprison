# Data-visualization-with-tableau-and-matplotlib-comaprison
this is a pdf about the findings about the data and you can also find a link to my tableau public + in the readme you can find my camaprison between it and matplotlib
in this tableau file you will find the visualizations and filters 
**Why tableau is important
This will be great representation if you want to represent this to a board or other non technical staff
Tableau will be your best companion to drive your insights to marketting teams or other departments 
**why matplotlib is important
you can easly drive and see your filter in any platform using matplotlib and it is more technical of course
you can see the changes you make and get much more data and apply changes using matplotlib 
you can use it to visualize what python or pandas function you use
**In which points tableau is better
when getting your data cleaned and want to visualize in an interactive way with active filters and no code
you can also get great insights in tableau not compared with matplotlib but in faster time to learn

*in the end every technology is important but Matplotlib is for programmers to see their insights and can be better for them than tableau 
but tableau has easier interface and not the same features as matplotlib but if you have better data
